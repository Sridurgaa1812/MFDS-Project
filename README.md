# CH5019 - Mathematical Foundations of Data Science - Course Project
An instructor wants to grade answers to descriptive questions automatically. The instructor has a template best answer that she/he has developed and wants to use the same to grade descriptive answers of students. The comparison results between the template and the student-provided answer could be categorical (right vs wrong) or continuous (75% similarity). 

You are expected to develop an AI algorithm that can do this comparison automatically. 

Please develop an algorithm through any appropriate concept and demonstrate the results on ten test cases. You can use any training approach and test it on any 10 test cases that you feel are appropriate. Your algorithm should take two paragraphs, one correct answer and one student-provided answer and return a result. Since this is a rather open-ended problem, the solutions will be largely evaluated based on the creativity associated with problem formulation, solution approach (including feature engineering), and the achieved results. Please use existing AI/ML libraries as much as possible.

Please remember that there is no single correct method.
